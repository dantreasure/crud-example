#HOMEWORK

1. Use bootstrap components (probably a form), to give the user an ability to write posts. match the posts to the format of the original json-server example with a body too.

```
 { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode", "body": "This is the post body!" }
 ```

2. When clicks 'Submit', grab the form fields and do a POST request to the JSON-server to save the post.

3. Use bootstrap components to display the current posts as well

 - Include a delete button to delete the post


##BONUS ROUND!!!!

4. Allow the user to edit the posts.
